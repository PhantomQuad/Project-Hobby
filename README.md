# Project-Hobby

This website is a personal hobby project that aims to educate others on the fitness program known as CrossFit. The website provides an introduction to CrossFit and its various components, including cardio and stamina, strength and power, flexibility and agility, speed and coordination, and balance and accuracy. The website is designed to be simple yet informative, and it serves as a means for me to share my passion for CrossFit with others.
